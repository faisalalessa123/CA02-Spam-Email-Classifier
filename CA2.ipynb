        "In this assignment, a spam email classification system was developed using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. The raw email text data was processed by building a dictionary of the most frequent words and converting each email into a numerical feature representation based on word frequencies. Using these features, the Naive Bayes model was trained on a labeled training dataset and evaluated on a separate test dataset. The resulting accuracy demonstrates that the model is able to effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Overall, this approach shows that probabilistic machine learning models such as Naive Bayes can perform well on text classification tasks with relatively simple feature extraction techniques."
